            <p id="text_box">It is no secret that many hands make the work light. Ending the cycle of poverty and bettering the lives of the less-fortunate requires a massive effort.  Good people necessarily must become involved, no matter how busy they very likely may be.
                <br>
            Here's how you can help.

            <p id="text_box">We created Unity Garden in order to give everyone access to healthy, nutritious food that also nourishes communities globally. Our plethora of online resources in the form of courses on how to source, grow, and nurture micro-gardens allow for measured and improved awareness of our organizational model. Anyone can spearhead new chapters within their community.
